# My Leetcode Solution in Rust

> This project is based on <https://github.com/aylei/leetcode-rust>, but with my own rust code and certain issue fixed, e.g.:
> 
> 1. Problem code to markdown conversion.
> 2. Uses <https://github.com/r12f/lcrt> for simpler final code.
> 3. A bit different template and removing comments from the demo source code, since they are included in the lcrt lib already.

Run `cargo run` to initialize the template submission file of "question #id".

Run `cargo test test_{id}` to test the solution for "question #id".

## Usage

* Remove all the solution .rs
* Clean lib.rs file
* Start your leetcode journey in rust by typing `cargo run`
