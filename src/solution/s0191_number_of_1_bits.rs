//!
//! Write a function that takesÂ the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).
//!
//! **Note:**
//!
//! * Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
//! * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.
//!
//! **Example 1:**
//!
//! ```
//! Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
//! Output: 3
//! Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
//!
//! ```
//!
//! **Example 2:**
//!
//! ```
//! Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
//! Output: 1
//! Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
//!
//! ```
//!
//! **Example 3:**
//!
//! ```
//! Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
//! Output: 31
//! Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
//!
//! ```
//!
//! **Constraints:**
//!
//! * The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.
//!
//! **Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
//!

#[solution]
impl Solution {
    pub fn hammingWeight(mut n: u32) -> i32 {
        let mut result = 0;

        while n > 0 {
            result += 1;
            n &= n - 1;
        }

        result
    }
